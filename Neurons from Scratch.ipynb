    "# Example Neuron from Scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "This code defines a simple artificial neuron and uses it to calculate the output of the neuron given certain inputs and weights. Here's a breakdown of the code:   \n",
    "\n",
    "1. `import math`: This imports the math module, which provides mathematical functions like `exp` (exponential function).   \n",
    "2. `sigmoid(x)`: This function implements the sigmoid activation function, which is commonly used in artificial neural networks. It takes a single argument `x` and returns the sigmoid of `x`, calculated as `1 / (1 + math.exp(-x))`.   \n",
    "3. `activate(inputs, weights)`: This function calculates the output of the neuron given inputs and corresponding weights. It first computes the net input `h` by summing the element-wise multiplication of inputs and weights. Then, it returns the output of the neuron by applying the sigmoid activation function to `h`.   \n",
    "4. `inputs` and `weights`: These are the input values and corresponding weights for the neuron.   \n",
    "5. `output = activate(inputs, weights)`: This line calculates the output of the neuron using the `activate` function with the provided inputs and weights.   \n",
    "6. `print(output)`: This prints the output of the neuron to the console.   \n",
    "   \n",
    "In this example, the output of the neuron is calculated as the sigmoid of the sum of `(0.5 \\* 0.4) + (0.3 \\* 0.7) + (0.2 \\* 0.2)`, which is approximately `0.610639233949222`.   "
